# Otriples.Api

ðŸš€ **Otriples.Api** is a modern reimplementation of the [OtripleS](https://github.com/hassanhabib/OtripleS) open-source school management system. This version introduces new architectural practices, including the **REPR Design Pattern (Request-Endpoint-Response)** and **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**, while staying aligned with the clean architecture and coding standards established by **Hassan Habib**.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals

- Rebuild the OtripleS system with a **cleaner, more scalable architecture**.
- Adopt **REPR Pattern** for consistent API structure and clear separation of concerns.
- Integrate **CQRS** to separate read and write responsibilities for better performance and maintainability.
- Stick to best practices for **domain modeling, testing, and clean code**.

## ðŸ§± Key Architectural Choices

### âœ… REPR (Request-Endpoint-Response) Pattern
- Ensures clear **endpoint contracts** using dedicated `Request` and `Response` DTOs.
- Promotes consistency across all API endpoints.
- Enhances readability and maintainability.

### âœ… CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
- Clean separation between **read models** (queries) and **write models** (commands).
- Reduces complexity for larger systems and improves scalability.

- **Entity Framework Core / Dapper**
- **ASP.NET Core Web API**
- **Swagger**
- **xUnit / NSubstitute**
- **FluentAssertions**
